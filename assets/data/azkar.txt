-Allah is all-Hearing to all those who gives praise to Him in all places,
all praise be to You our Lord, O Lord of all security;

-Abundant, pure and blessed praise (to) You, O the Beneficent,
a most obligatory, blessed (praise) given with all pleasure to our Lord;

-Your praise abound in the heavens and the earth with all goodness,
and all that You will after this abound with Your Praise on the Scales;

-O You Possessor of praise and majesty without enumeration,
the truest thing a slave has said (of You) with words and emotion;



-And each and everyone of us is Your slave without any exceptions,
O Allah, none can prevent what You have willed to bestow with all authority;

-And none can bestow what You have willed to deny of any denial,
and no wealth or majesty can benefit anyone, as from You is all wealth and majesty in all the worlds;

-All praise be to You for all that You bestow and deny, O You the Sublime,
and to You belongs everything everywhere in coldness and ebullition;

-Everything has a measure and an appointed time with You without forgetting anything,
and there is no changing what has been decreed except with supplication as is stated in the Holy Qur'aan;



-O Allah make the ending of all our affairs good for us,
and save us from all the humiliations of this world and the punishment of the Hereafter;

-O Allah bless this our Ummah from it's beginning,
(Which is) the Dawn of Guidance (for all the mankind), to it's middle and right up till it's end;

-A justly balanced community for Your Noble Prophet, the one sent with the right guidance,
and all his followers, helpers of Your Book, people of understanding;

-May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his household, the people of piety,
and upon us too and all Your slaves, the leaders of mankind;



-O Allah bless for us our earliness and our limbs,
and bless for us our early mornings and evenings;

-And bless for us our mornings and nights, O You the Praise-worthy,
and bless for us our religion and life, O You the Majestic;

-O Allah forgive all our sins without exceptions and have mercy on us,
and assist us in remembering You, and in showing gratitude to You and in perfecting our worship of You;

-O Allah increase us in all goodness and never decrease us,
and honour us in the worlds and never humiliate us;



-And give us from Your mercy and never deny us,
and prefer us amongst Your slaves and never prefer anyone over us;

-And make us to be pleased among the righteous and be pleased with us,
and save us from trials and tribulations and cover our our imperfections;

-And make our homes spacious for us with Your Bounty,
and bless for us our provosions with Your Grace;

-And protect us from all evil and wipe out our shortcomings,
and be for us in all our ups and downs and never be against us;



-O Allah we seek refuge in You from the cessation of Your kindness,
and we seek sanctuary in You from the unexpected occurrence of Your Punishment, O You the Most Strong Lord;

-There is certainly no refuge nor safe haven from You except with You,
from You we seek refuge from the changing of Your Goodness towards us, O You the Helper;

-And we seek refuge in You from the descension of Your anger upon us, O You the Most Noble Lord,
and from the aversion of our faces from the Light of Your Countenance;

-And from You we seek assistance from Your Divine Decree, O You the Supporter,
and we ask for success with Paradise when we meet You on the Day of Judgement;



-We ask for mercy from You, O our Lord,
that You guide our hearts by it at all times;

-And put our people in order with Your honour, O You the Helper,
and to make right with it the integrity of our actions in this world and the Hereafter;

-And to restore the harmony amongst us, O You the Affectionate Lord,
and to protect us with from all harms and the evil of our actions;

-Faith and not disbelief (we achieve with it) with Your Grace, O our God,
and mercy we achieve with it ************* by Your Grace.
